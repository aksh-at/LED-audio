# Direct port of the Arduino NeoPixel library strandtest example.  Showcases
# various animations on a strip of NeoPixels.

# LED strip configuration:
LED_COUNT      = 150      # Number of LED pixels.
LED_PIN        = 18      # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (must support PWM!).
LED_FREQ_HZ    = 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
LED_DMA        = 5       # DMA channel to use for generating signal (try 5)
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 10     # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
LED_INVERT     = False   # True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift)

# Main program logic follows:
if __name__ == '__main__':
	# Create NeoPixel object with appropriate configuration.
	strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN, LED_FREQ_HZ, LED_DMA, LED_INVERT, LED_BRIGHTNESS)
	# Intialize the library (must be called once before other functions).
	strip.begin()
	strip.show()
